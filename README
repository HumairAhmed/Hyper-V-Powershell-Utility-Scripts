The scripts are run locally on the Hyper-V server from a remote desktop connection:

1. getVMs.ps1 - prints a list of VMs (powered-on and powered-off VMs) on the Hyper-V server

2. shutdownVM.ps1 - shutsdown the VM; if the VM name is not passed in as an argument, it will prompt you for the 
                    name of the VM

3. startVM.ps1 - starts the VM; if the VM name is not passed in as an argument, it will prompt you for the 
                 name of the VM
